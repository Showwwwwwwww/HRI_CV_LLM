1,0:00:08,0:00:14,SPEAKER 2," Also, here is just another issue for the Llama2. "
2,0:00:14,0:00:23,SPEAKER 3," Here, for the user, it should not have any input just appear on this console, "
3,0:00:23,0:00:29,SPEAKER 4, because it can only just accept the input from my text file. 
4,0:00:29,0:00:36,SPEAKER 5," But purely in here, you see something, this kind of thing is just generated by itself. "
5,0:00:36,0:00:42,SPEAKER 6," Oh, it generates inputs from the user, even though the user didn't say anything. "
6,0:00:42,0:00:48,SPEAKER 7," Yeah, not just say anything, if this Llama2 recognizes the user, "
7,0:00:48,0:00:54,SPEAKER 8," his question or just his sentence is not clear or just complete, "
8,0:00:54,0:00:58,SPEAKER 9, it will automatically try to fill out the...

,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:11,SPEAKER 1," Sometimes, but if the people have the conversation with Bob with a clear sentence, I think it works, but sometimes not. "
1,0:00:11,0:00:20,SPEAKER 2," And, yeah, as you can see, for the response right now, it needs some, yeah, it's still like generating the response. "
2,0:00:20,0:00:27,SPEAKER 3," It just takes some time to, I think it's more time, because my GPU is not fast. "
3,0:00:27,0:00:39,SPEAKER 4," And also, I think here the first issue will be like the llama will generate, will automatically fill up the sentence, just the input from the user. "
4,0:00:39,0:00:43,SPEAKER 5," And the second issue, yeah, this is the issue. "
5,0:00:43,0:00:50,SPEAKER 6," And another thing can be solved with just the efficiency about the program, the GPU things. "
6,0:00:50,0:00:53,SPEAKER 7, Like the delay. 
7,0:00:53,0:00:56,SPEAKER 8," Yeah, the delay to generate the response. "
8,0:00:56,0:00:56,SPEAKER 9, And also the delay for generating the response.

,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:06,SPEAKER 1, yeah it just does start listening and you can generate a transcript I was 
1,0:00:06,0:00:12,SPEAKER 2, sometimes the speaker the speaker recognize it's not recognition is not 
2,0:00:12,0:00:18,SPEAKER 3, too accurate even just for me during some some testing I just personally I 
3,0:00:18,0:00:22,SPEAKER 4, just one person speak but it's just it's recognized like four people 
4,0:00:22,0:00:28,SPEAKER 5, identify like four speakers sometimes but it don't happen really just I just 
5,0:00:28,0:00:28,SPEAKER 6, keep silence and generate 
,Start,End,Speaker,Text

0,0:00:00,0:00:08,SPEAKER 1," Sorry, the window is kind of messy that's why if you can if you run it separately and you found like an "

0,0:00:00,0:00:00,SPEAKER 1, Yeah.

2,0:00:02,0:00:02,SPEAKER 3, Yeah. 
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:08,SPEAKER 1, here just have some problem like it will still the problem sometimes yeah it can 
1,0:00:08,0:00:16,SPEAKER 2, be like yeah sometimes it will get messy when I'm not here but sometimes it 
2,0:00:16,0:00:22,SPEAKER 3, will happen I don't know if the reason is because the the parameter for my 
3,0:00:22,0:00:26,SPEAKER 4, laptop right now is very slow I just use the 7 billion version but they 
4,0:00:26,0:00:33,SPEAKER 5, still have the 13 billion and the I think 70 70 billion to go to upgrade to 
5,0:00:33,0:00:39,SPEAKER 6, more fancy is this one using the vision module this one is not if I use the 
6,0:00:39,0:00:46,SPEAKER 7, vision module input I tested before it can yeah just right now if I run the 
7,0:00:46,0:00:55,SPEAKER 8, vision module and okay let me show run the vision module yeah if I run it okay 
8,0:00:55,0:00:55,SPEAKER 9, you can recommend me as a white good it 
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:07,SPEAKER 1, so this one for the llama llama 2 is not use pytorch just the c++ the c++ version 
1,0:00:07,0:00:07,SPEAKER 2, while and also for the wish we show this this i think i can just 
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:12,SPEAKER 1, what yes name pie torch this torch okay it's just 2.1 the newest yeah I think 
1,0:00:12,0:00:17,SPEAKER 2, quite new version this one is a new version and whisper I think the whisper 
2,0:00:17,0:00:17,SPEAKER 3, is used I'm not sure but the whisper uses different non-pie version 
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:05,SPEAKER 1, but just the reason is like I think for the NumPy version it's 1.0 
1,0:00:05,0:00:11,SPEAKER 2, that's fine NumPy you can specify specific version and it's still 
2,0:00:11,0:00:11,SPEAKER 3, compatible 1.24 should be compatible with both 
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:04,SPEAKER 1," 1.26, 1.25, I'll just try. "
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:10,SPEAKER 1, together at first and because this one is a c++ i'm just that's why i'm talking about why this is frozen 
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:36,SPEAKER 1, Just because I think the main issue is because the llama at least I  Ideally I can combine vision and the whisper together  But here have another two things join which the first one is llama llama is the C++  Version this I only have to see C++ version the Python version is not it's not going where I  Tried before but it doesn't work very well and another thing is for the part for the paper paper paper  Pepper is using Python to end  like two different Python version another two and I know 
1,0:00:38,0:00:53,SPEAKER 2," Yes, so it's like I think in Jay's project he just have a separate environment that only  Handles the communication with the robot, you know getting data from robot  Yes, sending the sentence to the robot to speak  And then you have a separate environment for all of the YOLO and the "
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:05,SPEAKER 3," So the robot is just doing very simple tasks, you don't have to worry about that. "
1,0:00:05,0:00:10,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, the robot just records the audio and just speaks. "
2,0:00:10,0:00:13,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, record and speak, and send the images. "
3,0:00:13,0:00:28,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, and also just a fun question for Layming.  The dialog, this API only works for the Google Cloud, right? "
4,0:00:28,0:00:58,SPEAKER 1," Oh yeah, this is the dialog flow, but you don't need to use dialog flow.  This is just to show you how to run a Python script that you have the Nauchi library for making the robot say something.  You have the function that was making the robot record.  And then at the end you have the main function that specify the connection to the robot by the IP address.  But for the dialog flow part you can just totally remove that and replace it with your llama and yolo. "
5,0:00:58,0:00:58,SPEAKER 4," Yeah, I got it. "
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:05,SPEAKER 3," and the whisperer, do you have any idea, like, combine the speakers? "
1,0:00:05,0:00:06,SPEAKER 2, Visual and whisperer. 
2,0:00:06,0:00:07,SPEAKER 5, Yeah. 
3,0:00:07,0:00:22,SPEAKER 3," Because the last time, just roughly, the idea from my side is to, like, detect any,  just order the, if the person's mouth open or something else.  Because otherwise, it's kind of hard to... "
4,0:00:22,0:00:26,SPEAKER 2," Can you run those two, visual and whisper together in one file? "
5,0:00:26,0:00:27,SPEAKER 6," Yeah, yeah. "
6,0:00:27,0:00:28,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, definitely. "
7,0:00:28,0:00:45,SPEAKER 3," Because originally, the whisperer is, this one, whisperer,  is accepted by, I think, the video file.  But it's just converts the video to the video and audio section.  Yeah, and it analyzes the audio. "
8,0:00:45,0:00:51,SPEAKER 2, And the video goes to visual.  Yeah.  And the audio goes to whisper. 
9,0:00:51,0:00:52,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, yeah, yeah. "
10,0:00:52,0:00:54,SPEAKER 2," Yeah, that's how you combine it. "
11,0:00:54,0:00:55,SPEAKER 1," Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah. "
12,0:00:55,0:00:56,SPEAKER 4, Right? 
13,0:00:56,0:00:58,SPEAKER 3," Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  And just in... "
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:12,SPEAKER 2," as a speaker. Yeah, one version.  Assuming that you are in a very quiet room  by yourself  talking with the robot  and I need that version  working first before you move on. "
1,0:00:12,0:00:18,SPEAKER 1," Yeah, got it. I think I can do it.  I'll try to do it today  and get in touch with you tomorrow. "
2,0:00:18,0:00:32,SPEAKER 2," Do you need to  access the GPU machine? I can give you  access to the GPU machine.  You can try installing the environment  on that GPU machine.  One environment for everything?  Yeah, okay. "
3,0:00:32,0:00:58,SPEAKER 1," Okay, I'm trying.  If you can, it will be good.  If you can give me that.  Okay, I think right now the step  is quite clear.  Just do the integration for these two  vision and visual at first.  And  also just another thing  like connect with  each things. Just try to reduce  the number of environments  and write a unified "
4,0:00:58,0:00:58,SPEAKER 2, Python file or something. 
,Start,End,Speaker,Text
0,0:00:00,0:00:07,SPEAKER 2," You have a way to connect the visual whisper together with the yeah, the llama should be okay. Yeah, okay "
1,0:00:09,0:00:54,SPEAKER 1," The visual model is also at the moment  We just have the human like the the ID and their age and gender  But we could also consider with your law adding in some of these general object recognition so that in the  like the the conversation then  People can also show stuff so other than like who is talking who is present at the conversation  You also get the visual context of what are people talking about as they like commenting on a specific  like painting or something  Yeah, yeah, I'm thinking last week's meeting  We also briefly talked about thinking on the like the user study site of what would be the  Interaction scenario that this conversation between the robot and a group of humans "
